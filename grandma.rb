# Write a speak_to_grandma method.

# IF YOUR YELLING AT GRANDMA, SHE WILL HEAR YOU
# SHE SCREMS BACK

# If you shout, she can hear you (or at least she thinks so)
# and yells back

# NO, NOT SINCE 1938!

# However if you say 'I LOVE YOU GRANDMA!', she should respond with
# 'I LOVE YOU TOO PUMPKIN!'
